        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Perla and I'm currently a student at the University of California of Riverside. This is my second year being in UCR. My major is Education and I have really enjoyed learning about Education. I have always wanted to be a teacher, ever since I started attending school. Seeing how the teachers teach and approach students to learn inspired me to want to do the same. So I might not have been teaching or actually be in the education field, but I have practiced for a long time. I started teaching my brother things when he was very young. I would  also teach my cousins and neighbors how to write certain words and how to pronounce them. I continued to teach and help others throughout the school years. <br><br>

        After middle school going into high school. I was offered to be in a program where I would be able to tutor elementary students in reading. I was very excited to actually use the tools and tricks I had learned on my own. The knowledge I had already had helped me overcome a lot. Students would not want to do the readings. So I would motivate them by saying that they had come so far to just give up now or I would tell them how proud I would be if they finished the book by the end of the week. These words really made students want to try harder in reading. When the school year ended I was offered another opportunity to start learning on the Education system. That summer they prepared as if I was going to be a teacher, I went through lots of training on how to teach students. I earned about five certificates and got offered the position of being a bilingual tutor. I accepted and put my skills to work.<br><br>

        I had just finished high school and was about to enter college. Although I loved teaching and helping students, I wanted to reach my career goal. I wanted to help out in another way as a psychologist. I applied to many of the colleges that offered psychology and hoped for the best but unfortunately the school I wanted to attend didnâ€™t accept me in psychology but in my second choice Education. So accepted and went with being a Education major and really couldnâ€™t have asked for more. I enjoy learning now the causes of why the education system is the way it is and how we can improve it. Iâ€™m currently in the process of being in the field of teaching to get more experience in the field. I canâ€™t wait to use what I learned in college these two years and apply it to actual students. To be able to do this, I need to be fully prepared, meaning I need to take and do certain trannings to be allowed to teach. I have done four out of five. Once finishing my training I will be able to practice what I have learned.
